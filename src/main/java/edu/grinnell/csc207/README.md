# Classical Encryption Project

**Author**: Moise Milenge

## Project Description
This project implements classical encryption techniques such as the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher. It includes:
- **`CipherUtils`**: A utility class that provides static methods for encrypting and decrypting text using both ciphers.
- **`AllCaesar`**: A command-line utility that prints all possible Caesar cipher shifts for a given input.
- **`Cipher`**: A command-line utility that allows flexible encoding/decoding using either the Caesar or Vigenère cipher.

## Resources Used
1. **Google Java Style Guide** - Ensured that the code follows style guidelines for consistent formatting and clarity.
2. **StackOverflow** - Consulted for resolving general Java syntax and design questions, such as handling edge cases in string manipulation.
3. **Course Readings/Notes** - Referenced for understanding the theory behind classical encryption and the structure of the project.
